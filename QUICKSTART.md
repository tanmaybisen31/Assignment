# Autodialer - Quick Start Guide

Get your Autodialer app running in 5 minutes!

## Prerequisites Checklist

- [ ] Ruby 3.0+ installed (`ruby -v`)
- [ ] Bundler installed (`gem install bundler`)
- [ ] Redis installed and running (`redis-server`)
- [ ] SQLite3 installed

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Install & Setup

```bash
cd autodialer
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Install all Ruby gems
- Create the database
- Run migrations
- Seed with 100 phone numbers (2 real + 98 test numbers)

### Step 2: Start the App

```bash
./start.sh
```

This starts both Sidekiq and Rails server automatically.

### Step 3: Open Browser

Visit: **http://localhost:3000**

## Making Your First Call

### Option 1: AI Command (Easiest!)

1. Look for the purple **"AI Command Interface"** box
2. Type: `call 8081471151`
3. Press **Send**
4. Watch the call happen in real-time!

### Option 2: Use Autodialer

1. Click **"Generate Test Numbers"** (if not already done)
2. Set delay between calls (default: 10 seconds)
3. Click **"Start Autodialer"**
4. Watch calls being made automatically!

### Option 3: Bulk Upload

1. Paste phone numbers in the text area (one per line)
2. Click **"Upload Numbers"**
3. Click **"Start Autodialer"**

## Testing with Ngrok (For Real Calls)

If you want Twilio to send webhooks (for AI voice interaction):

```bash
# In a new terminal
ngrok http 3000
```

Copy the HTTPS URL and:

```bash
export NGROK_URL="https://abc123.ngrok.io"
```

Then restart the app.

## What Numbers Are Safe to Call?

### Real Numbers (WILL RECEIVE CALLS):
- **8081471151** ← Your test number 1
- **9693764689** ← Your test number 2

### Test Numbers (Safe - Won't Actually Call):
- All **1800-XXX-XXXX** numbers (toll-free format)
- Generated automatically by the app

```

## Troubleshooting

### "Redis is not running"

### AI commands not working?
1. Check Gemini API key in `config/application.rb`
2. Check your API quota in Google Cloud Console
