# Git Workflow Strategies for Teams

Git workflows define how teams collaborate using version control. The right workflow improves productivity, reduces conflicts, and makes collaboration smooth. This guide explores popular Git workflows and best practices.

## Git Flow

Git Flow is a branching model designed for projects with scheduled releases.

### Branch Types:
- master: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch for features
- feature/*: New features
- release/*: Release preparation
- hotfix/*: Emergency production fixes

### Workflow:
1. Create feature branch from develop
2. Develop feature and commit changes
3. Merge feature into develop
4. Create release branch from develop
5. Merge release into master and develop
6. Tag master with version number

Commands:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/user-auth develop
# work on feature
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/user-auth
git branch -d feature/user-auth
```

## GitHub Flow

Simpler workflow ideal for continuous deployment.

### Rules:
- master is always deployable
- Create descriptive branch names
- Open pull request early
- Deploy after review and CI pass
- Merge to master after deployment

### Workflow:
1. Create branch from master
2. Make commits
3. Open pull request
4. Discuss and review
5. Deploy to test
6. Merge to master
7. Deploy to production

Commands:
```bash
git checkout -b add-payment-feature master
# make changes
git push origin add-payment-feature
# Create PR on GitHub
# After review and approval
git checkout master
git merge add-payment-feature
git push origin master
```

## Trunk-Based Development

Developers work on short-lived branches or directly on master.

### Principles:
- Keep branches short-lived (< 2 days)
- Integrate frequently
- Use feature flags for incomplete work
- Maintain high test coverage
- Automate everything

### Best For:
- Teams with strong CI/CD
- Mature testing practices
- Small, frequent releases

## Best Practices

### 1. Commit Messages
```bash
# Good
git commit -m "Add user authentication with JWT"
git commit -m "Fix: Resolve memory leak in image processing"
git commit -m "Refactor: Extract email service to separate module"

# Bad
git commit -m "update"
git commit -m "fix bug"
git commit -m "asdf"
```

### 2. Branch Naming
```bash
# Good
feature/user-authentication
bugfix/login-error
hotfix/security-patch
refactor/database-layer

# Bad
my-branch
test
new-feature
```

### 3. Pull Requests
- Write clear descriptions
- Keep changes focused
- Request specific reviewers
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Keep PRs small (< 400 lines)

### 4. Merge Strategies

**Merge Commit** (preserves history):
```bash
git merge --no-ff feature-branch
```

**Squash and Merge** (clean history):
```bash
git merge --squash feature-branch
git commit -m "Add complete user feature"
```

**Rebase** (linear history):
```bash
git rebase master
```

## Conclusion

Choose a workflow that fits your team size, release cadence, and deployment practices. Start simple, adapt as needed, and always prioritize clear communication and collaboration.
